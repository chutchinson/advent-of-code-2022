# Advent of Code 2022

An Advent of Code 2022 solver written in Kotlin.

This is my first time learning and using Kotlin, inspired by this contest operated by JetBrains:

# Caveats

This software was written for personal use and suffers from a lack of documentation, no warranty of any kind, and is not necessarily representative of quality work.

# Goals

- **Education**. I am learning Kotlin.
- **Pragmatism**. I want to have fun, so I may favor simplicity over efficiency. Optimization is often fun, but not always.
